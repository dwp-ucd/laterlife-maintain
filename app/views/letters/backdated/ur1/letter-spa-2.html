<p>Dear Participant One,</p>
<p>Following your claim for State Pension, you will get:<br>
<br>
<b>£884.60 every 4 weeks</b><br>

<p><b>One-off payment</b></p>
<p>You'll get a one-off payment of £11,355.79 on 20 December 2022. This is<br>  because you backdated your State Pension.<br>
<br>
It covers 8 December 2021 to 7 December 2022 and includes the £10 <br> Christmas Bonus.<br>
<br>
<b>Your regular payments</b></p>
<p>Your regular payments of £884.60 every 4 weeks start from 17 <br> January 2023.</p>
  <p>
  <b>Why your payments are different</b></p>
<p>The amount of State Pension you get has changed since 8 <br>December 2021. You are entitled to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>£214.52 a week from 8 December 2021 to 11 April 2022</li>
  <li>£221.15 a week from 12 April 2022</li>
  </ul>
<p>These amounts include extra State Pension because you delayed the start <br>of your claim from 28 July 2018 to 8 December 2021.</p>

<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<br>
The State Pension Team
